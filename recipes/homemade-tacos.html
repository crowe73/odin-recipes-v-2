                meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, 
                garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the 
                meat is cooked through, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.

                Reduce heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to 
                combine. cook, sitrring occasionally, for 7 to 8 minutes, until some 
                of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little 
                saucy. Remove from the heat.
