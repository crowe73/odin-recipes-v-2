        <p>
            Pan searing at it's best and the easiest way to cook a steak. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 (12 ounce) New York strip or ribeye steaks about 1 1/2 inches thick
            </li>
            <li>1 heaping teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>A few sprigs of fresh thyme leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To begin with, pat steaks with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Season the steaks all over with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>
                Turn on the exhaust fan and heat a cast iron or stainless steel pan 
                over medium-high heat until it is very hot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer and move fluidly
                around the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully set the steaks in the pan, releasing them away from you so 
                the oil doesn't splatter in your direction. The oil should sizzle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave the steaks alone. The steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to 
                develope a golden crust. Flip the steaks when they release easily and 
                the bottom is a deep brown color, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook 
                the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the second side for rare 
                to medium-rare. (For medium, cook 4 to 5 minutes on second side; for
                well-done, cook 5 to 6 minutes on second side).
            </li>
            <li>
                During the last minute of cooking, add the butter and thyme sprigs to 
                the pan with the steaks.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve 
                hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board 
                and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then 
                slice thinly against the grain.

        </ol>
